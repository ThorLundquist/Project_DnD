# Project_DnD
A game loosely based on the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, fifth edition.
Made in the Unity engine.

We (project partner and I) started this project as a part of our education. Our intentions are to both grow as developers, 
and hopefully pick up a few tools along the way. Right now we're in the middle part of our education. 

README is a work in progress.
